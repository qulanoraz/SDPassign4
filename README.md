I made a project about controlling different devices, like TVs and radios, using the Bridge design pattern. My goal was to make a system where I can add new devices or new types of remote controls easily, without changing a lot of code.

How the Project Works -
There are two main parts in my project:

Devices: These are things like TV and Radio. They have actions like turn on, turn off, and set volume.

Remote Controls: These are used to control the devices. I made a basic remote and an advanced remote. The advanced remote can also mute the device.

The Bridge pattern helped me to connect any remote control with any device. For example, I can use the same remote for both TV and Radio. Also, I can add new devices or new remotes in the future very easily.
